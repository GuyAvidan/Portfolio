# Group Chat

Welcome to my project on GitHub - the Group Chat application. This repository is dedicated to showcasing a robust group chat system developed as a group project. Our task was to create a chat application that supports multiple chat groups, a diverse user base, and password-protected user accounts. The project demonstrates the implementation of a client-server architecture and broadcasting functionality to the entire group.

## Project Overview
The Group Chat application allows users to connect to the chat server, join specific chat groups, and engage in real-time conversations with other users. The project emphasizes the importance of networking concepts, socket programming, and data encryption to ensure reliable and secure communication among users. It serves as an excellent example of creating a collaborative and interactive chat system.

## Key Features
The Group Chat application offers the following key features:
1. **Multiple Chat Groups:** Users can join different chat groups based on their interests or topics of discussion, facilitating organized and focused conversations.
2. **User Authentication:** Each user is assigned a unique username and password, ensuring secure access to the chat system and protecting user privacy.
3. **Real-time Communication:** Users can exchange messages in real-time, enabling seamless and interactive conversations within the chat groups.
4. **Client-Server Architecture:** The project employs a client-server architecture, allowing multiple clients to connect to a centralized server and facilitating efficient communication among users.
5. **Broadcasting Functionality:** The chat application supports broadcasting messages to the entire group, ensuring that important announcements or updates reach all participants.
6. **Modular Codebase:** The codebase is organized into separate modules, handling different aspects of the application such as user authentication, group management, and message broadcasting. This modular structure promotes code reusability and ease of maintenance.

Thank you for exploring the Group Chat application. Enjoy connecting with others and engaging in meaningful conversations within the chat groups!

Happy chatting!
