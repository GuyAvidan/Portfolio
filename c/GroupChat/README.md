Welcome to my project on GitHub - the Group Chat application. This project was developed as a group project, where our task was to create a robust group chat system that supports multiple chat groups, a diverse user base, and password-protected user accounts. The project showcases the implementation of both the client-server architecture and broadcasting functionality to the entire group.

The Group Chat application allows users to connect to the chat server, join specific chat groups, and engage in real-time conversations with other users. Each user is assigned a unique username and password, ensuring secure access to the chat system. The project emphasizes the importance of networking concepts, socket programming, and data encryption to ensure reliable and secure communication among users.

The codebase is organized into separate modules, handling different aspects of the application, such as user authentication, group management, and message broadcasting. The repository includes the complete source code, detailed documentation, and any additional resources required to set up and run the Group Chat application.
