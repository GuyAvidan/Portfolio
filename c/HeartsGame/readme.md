## Project Overview
The Hearts card game is a classic trick-taking game played with a standard deck of cards by four players. The objective of the game is to avoid capturing certain penalty cards while collecting hearts and the queen of spades. Players take turns playing cards from their hands, following specific rules and strategies to win tricks and achieve the lowest score possible. The project serves as an excellent opportunity to explore game development concepts using C.
