I am delighted to introduce my project on GitHub - the Hearts card game. This project is implemented in the C programming language and is aimed at users who want to delve into game development using C and enhance their programming abilities.

The Hearts card game is a classic trick-taking game played with a standard deck of cards by four players. The objective of the game is to avoid capturing certain penalty cards while collecting hearts and the queen of spades. Players take turns playing cards from their hands, following specific rules and strategies to win tricks and achieve the lowest score possible.

The project showcases key elements of game development, including card management, player interaction, and game logic. The code is structured into modular functions, promoting readability, reusability, and ease of maintenance. The repository includes the source code, documentation, and any additional resources necessary to run the game.
