# Tic Tac Toe
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the Tic Tac Toe game project! This repository is dedicated to presenting a versatile implementation of the popular Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The project aims to provide a customizable and interactive way to play the game on boards of various sizes while also serving as a learning resource for Python programming.

## Project Overview
The Tic Tac Toe game project is designed to recreate the classic game that we all know and love. It offers a command-line interface where players can take turns placing their markers (X or O) on a grid of any size. The objective of the game remains the same: get a line of three of your markers in a row, column, or diagonal while preventing your opponent from doing the same. The project provides flexibility by allowing users to customize the board size and enjoy the game on larger grids.

## Key Features
The Tic Tac Toe game project offers the following key features:
1. **Player vs. Player:** The game allows two human players to play against each other, taking turns and strategizing their moves.
2. **Player vs. AI:** For solo play, the game provides an option to play against an AI opponent. Test your skills against the computer and see if you can outsmart it!
3. **Customizable Board Size:** The project enables users to specify the size of the game board, allowing for larger grids beyond the traditional 3x3. This flexibility provides a new dimension to the gameplay experience.
4. **User-Friendly Interface:** The application features a simple and intuitive command-line interface, making it easy for players to interact with the game and place their markers on the grid.
5. **Input Validation:** The project incorporates input validation to ensure that players enter valid moves, preventing any invalid or out-of-bounds inputs.
6. **Winning Condition Detection:** The game includes logic to detect winning conditions, automatically declaring a winner when a player successfully forms a line of three markers.
7. **Game Over Detection:** The application recognizes when the game ends in a draw or when a player wins, displaying the appropriate message to the players.
8. **Replay Option:** After the game ends, players have the choice to restart the game and play again, allowing for multiple rounds of fun.

Thank you for exploring the Tic Tac Toe game project. Enjoy playing the game, whether it's against a friend or challenging the AI, and have fun enhancing your Python programming skills!

Let the Tic Tac Toe battles begin, against humans or the AI!
