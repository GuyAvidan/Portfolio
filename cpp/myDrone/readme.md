# My Drone
Welcome to the GitHub repository showcasing our Simple Drone project! This repository is dedicated to presenting a fascinating project that demonstrates the capabilities of a drone programmed in C++. The project showcases the implementation of a client-server architecture wrapped in a C++ compatible shell, allowing the drone to move in space using a console interface and return to its original position.

## Project Overview
Our Simple Drone project is designed to simulate the movement of a drone in space using a console interface. By leveraging C++ and a client-server architecture, we have created a dynamic and interactive program that allows users to control the drone's movement and observe its behavior. This project serves as an excellent example of utilizing various programming concepts and technologies to achieve a specific functionality.

## Key Features
Our Simple Drone project offers the following key features:
1. **Console Interface:** The project provides a user-friendly console interface that enables users to interact with the drone and control its movement.
2. **Drone Movement:** Users can command the drone to move in different directions, such as forward, backward, left, right, up, and down, using the console interface.
3. **Client-Server Architecture:** The project implements a client-server architecture to facilitate communication between the user interface and the drone's logic. This architecture allows for easy extensibility and separation of concerns.
4. **C++ Compatible Shell:** We have wrapped the client-server architecture within a C++ compatible shell, ensuring seamless integration and compatibility with the C++ programming language.
5. **Return to Original Position:** The drone has the capability to return to its original position, providing a convenient and reliable way to reset its location.
6. **Modularity and Scalability:** The project is designed with modularity and scalability in mind, allowing for future enhancements, such as additional drone functionalities or integration with external sensors.

Thank you for exploring our Simple Drone project. Enjoy controlling the drone and witnessing its movement in space through the console interface!

Happy coding and safe flying!
